# Line 1 in the data file is mandatory. WH at pos 0 on that line means "With Header". NH at pos 0 means "No Header".
# No other values are to appear on Line 1
# Line 2 of the data file will either therefore be a header record (if WH) or a data record (if NH)
# Line 3 and subsequent lines will always be data records
# A file must contain at least 1 data record
# Other assumptions: be aware there is no footer record - the last record must be a data record
# A line starting with a hash like this in the format/spec file means it is a comment only, and will be ignored by the processing.
# There must be no blank lines in this spec file
# File positions on a record start at offset 0.
# This file is for say a list of friends... 
# In the very next line, 0 means "the start position for this field/column", 4 means the length of the field, Id is the name of the field
# In the Id field, if it is immediately followed by a square-bracketed, comma separated list of values, then those values are the allowed
# set. All values should be assumed to be case-insensitive.
The last line should contain no data/metadata

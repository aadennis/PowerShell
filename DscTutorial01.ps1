    Guts of a tutorial about PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) that assumes a push server 
    (from where this script runs), and 2 "client" servers accessed via private ip address on the same subnet.
    This script/push server pushes an instruction to set up a folder on each of the 2 client servers,
    as required.
    On the evidence, it is enough that the client servers are on the same subnet as the push server,
    and importantly, in the TrustedHosts: no credentials seem to be required.

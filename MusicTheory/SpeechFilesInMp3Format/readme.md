Practising guitar fretboard memorization, using audio files.
=======
***Before reading this, please play one of the files, to give you some context. For example 10SecPause.3Strings.20Notes.JoannaVoice.mp3***  

This is a collection of audio files, which ask you to find notes on a string, with a pause to give you time to find the note.  
The name of the file tells you more about its content.  
As an example, the name of this file...  
`10SecPause.3Strings.20Notes.JoannaVoice.mp3`  
means  
> 10 seconds pause between each note-utterance, 3 string iterations, 20 note-utterances, using the "Joanna" voice.

#### What is a note-utterance?  
It is the speaker uttering a note. A note is a letter between A and G. In the file name, "Notes" is actually shorthand for "Note-utterance".  
#### What is a string iteration?  
It is a set of note-utterances, with a pause between each note-utterance.  
#### Why does each file have 3 string iterations?  
That is just a convenient number to make a practise session last between 3 and 10 minutes. The exact duration is the number of Strings, multiplied by the number of Notes, multiplied by the pause length... plus any speech introduction, which is not much. If there is interest, I can make files with 1 to 10 iterations. Beyond that, there is a practical size limitation as audio files take up a lot of space. You can obviously put a given file into a loop until you get bored.
#### Why "JoannaVoice", "EmmaVoice", etc?
I use the [Amazon Polly console][1] to generate audio from the [SSML][2] files. `Joanna` for example, is one of the English USA voices. `Emma` is 1 of the English UK voices. I have found that some of the UK recorded [phonemes][3] are not perfect, hence hopping between the 2 regions. Even using [IPA][4] for a more precise rendering has not helped.
#### So it's just a set of audio files. How does that help me improve my memory of the fretboard?

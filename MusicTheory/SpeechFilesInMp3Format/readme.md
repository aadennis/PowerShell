Summary
=======
This is for practising guitar fretboard memorization.  
It is a collection of mp3 files.  
Each file asks you to find x notes on a given string at intervals of y seconds.  

As an example, the name of this file...  
`10SecPause.3Strings.20Notes.JoannaVoice.mp3`  
means  
`10 seconds pause between each note-utterance, 3 string iterations, 20 note-utterances, using the "Joanna" voice.`

#### What is a note-utterance?  
It is the speaker uttering a note. A note is a letter between A and G. In the file name, "Notes" is actually shorthand for "Note-utterance".  
#### What is a string iteration?  
It is a set of note-utterances, with a pause between each note-utterance.  
#### Why does each file have 3 string iterations?  
That is just a convenient number to make a practise session last between 3 and 10 minutes. The exact duration is the number of Strings, multiplied by the number of Notes, multiplied by the pause length... plus any speech introduction, which is not much. If there is interest, I can make files with 1 to 10 iterations. Beyond that, there is a practical size limitation as audio files take up a lot of space.
